# Success Criteria for Marconi Books Project

The Marconi Books project will be considered a success if:

## A fully functional test system is delivered on or before the day we will present the website

The system shall be delivered in a state that is ready to be used in its intended production environment for its intended purpose. The users shall be given the training they need in order to begin using the system. We will consider both of these goals met if the users who plan to use the system during its test period can:

- Create a personal account

- Login to the website
- Add books to sell to their account
- See what other users are trying to sell
- Modify their account and delete the books they already sold

Concerns raised during the test period are addressed according to the problem resolution plan contained in the Software Project Management Plan

All critical defects found before the day we will present the website will be fixed.

If a user finds an error he should tell it to the administrators by writing them an email.

The administrators will provide, as soon as they notify the problem, to fix it and then notify it to the users.

Community Youth can easily log into the system.

This specifically means that a Youth will be able to select the login option, type their first and last name or some portion of their first and/or last name, select events and press a confirmation button.

## Marconi Books administrators can create and edit user accounts

This includes officer, volunteer and youth accounts. All data should be editable from the Internet interface.

The production database is updated.

When a user modifies his account the database will be automatically updated with new data.

The System is properly documented.

First, a user manual shall be produced and included with the system. This user manual shall be easy to understand for non-technical users familiar with basic Internet and spreadsheet concepts. This manual shall explain only how to use all features of the system.

Second, a system manual shall be produced. This system manual shall consist of the architecture document, as well as any additional material required to provide a technician with all necessary information needed to maintain and update the system. A single read through of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide an appropriately skilled technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as add a field to a generated report.
