# IDENTIFIER

Marconi Books Test Plan



# INTRODUCTION

This exercise essentially discovers faults and failures in the software. Faults lead to failures and testing is necessary to eliminate these errors in the software development process. The following document outlines the testing procedures for the Marconi Books web site project.

## Items and Features Tested

The features tested include the user website.

## Test Specifications

This section highlights the different levels of testing performed during the software development process. It includes integrations tests performed by the team tester and system tests performed by a team of testers to verify that the system fulfills the requirements and performs as expected. The complete testing procedures are outlined in the test specifications document.

## Test Reports

Test reportsoffer feedback about the testing exercise and are informational to project stakeholders. The reports in this testing exercise track incidents, defects, and changeswhile testing the system.

Incident reports track descriptions of incidents, the originator, severity and priority, steps required to produce the defect, the responder, current status, cause, resolution and date the incident was addressed.  The document will also track in what phase of the development process the incident was created or detected.

Defect reportsreference the unique identifier in the incident report, list affected items, the owner, required changes, status, phases where the defect was introduced and detected,and general comments or notes.

Change reportssummarize the total number of unit tests, integration tests, and system tests, the items and features tested, comprehensiveness of the assessment, the total number of incidents and defects, and unresolved incidents.

## Project Plan

The project plan reconciles the time schedule and release of candidates with the unit, integration, and system testing.







# ITEMS AND FEATURES TESTED

## User Website

User website testing takes place in the integration and system testing phases. During integration, the tester will test functions of the system and how the system behaves with additional features. During system testing, the team will test the system as a whole and cross-check the results with the requirements.

Test items:

- .Verify user account
- .User search a book
- .User reads the list of available books





# APPROACH

## Strategy

The testing approach includes team members role-playing by acting as users of the website and bulletin board participants. The activities they carry out will be similar to activities carried out by website user. These include posting and searching books back to the website, performing functions and other user activities. Team members will also create unexpected scenarios such as invalid input, to test how the system will respond to such scenarios.

System testing will be performed by the group to measure how the system fulfills the requirements. Team members will be required to provide input on the systems functionality to determine if it measures up to the client&#39;s expectations.

## Techniques/Tools

Developers will perform unit tests to check code functionality and execution of the software, and perform white-box testing.

Testers and team members will also go through the code to find bugs and errors that the developers might not detect.

## Test Goals

The goals of this testing exercise include finding various user situations and testing against these situations in order to discover any errors that may cause failures. The ultimate goal is to ensure that the team delivers an error-free functioning system.





# TEST DELIVERABLES

- A test plan that delineates the testing phase of the development process
- A test specification document detailing steps in the testing procedures
- Test reports documenting incidents, defects and changes





# SCHEDULE

Testing will occur at each phase of the development process. Test cases are outlined in the test specification document for the iterations.
