#1 Overview
##1.1 Purpose and Scope

Team 4 is interested in creating a mobile application that will be useful to students and give Marconi visibility. The Marconi Books platform accomplishes this by giving Marconi&#39;s students a way to keep track of school books information.

The Marconi Books website will provide users the ability to log in to their account via the Marconi Books website. Two features will allow users to see a list of disponible books and to add their books.

The user interface will be intuitive and simple to navigate. A user guide and system administration manual will be provided.

##1.2 Goals and Objectives

The overall objective is to give students an alternative way to buy and sell school books.

Project Goals:

Create a website that functions as expected, looks great.

Learn about software engineering and creating a website.

Project Objectives:

Create a website interface to give students access to their account information.

Create a website that functions in a simple and intuitive manner.

##1.5 Definitions

| **Term** | **Definition** |
| --- | --- |
| **Actor** | user or other software system that receives value from a user case. |
| **Baselined** | the work product has undergone a formal review and can only be changed through the prescribed change control procedures |
| **Client or Customer** | the person or organization for which this Roo Balance application is being built. |
| **Developer** | the person or organization developing the system, also sometimes called the supplier. |

| Email. Implement an online system to send email to the administrators in the Contact page. | 5 hrs |


#4 Control Plan

##4.1 Configuration Management Plan

The following procedure is to be used when making changes to all baselined work products:

- All project work products will be stored in a GitHub repository running on a central server.
- All baselined documents will have a history to track initialization and subsequent changes.
- All project work products (documents, source code, test cases, program data, test data, etc) will be stored in the GitHub repository but not all will be under change control (subject to formal change control procedures.) Only the system requirements, project plan and source code will be baselined and under configuration control.
- Items that are subject to change control will be considered baselined after a group review at the end of the initial document creation.

The change control procedure once a product is baselined is:

- anyone wanting to make a change to a baselined item sends an email to the rest of the team and project sponsor describing the change, reason for the change, expected schedule impact, and timeline for integrating the change.
- if no one responds to the group within 2 days with a reason for why the change request shouldn&#39;t be permitted, it will be considered accepted and the person proposing the change may proceed with the change.
- if anyone does object to the change, the reason for objecting will be discussed at a meeting where everyone is invited to attend and voice their opinion. At the end of the meeting a democratic vote will be held to decide whether or not the change should be allowed.
- if a change takes place, the initiator must collaborate with the project manager to update the schedule

#5 Supporting Process Plans
#5.1 Risk Management Plan

| **Rank** | **Risk** | **Probability of Loss** | **Size of Loss** | **Risk Exposure** | **Response** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Schedule / time line delivery | Likely | Major | High | Mitigate: Stick to the schedule. |
| 2 | Logistic problems | Likely | Moderate | Moderate | Follow the program and organize materials and tools. |
| 3 | Learning curve for new tools and technologies longer than expected | Unlikely | Moderate | Moderate | Buy Information: Begin working on a basic prototype early to test out fundamental programming concepts &amp; knowledge |

#5.2 Test Plan

The test plan defines the items that will be tested, methods for testing, and a schedule detailing the tasks, owners, and timeline.

#5.3 Product Acceptance Plan

At the conclusion of each iteration, the prototype created will tested to ensure it meets the requirements of that iteration.  An environment such as the iPhone simulator may be used to test functionality in lieu of the app being loaded on an actual smartphone.

For the final iteration, product acceptance testing will ensure that the prototype functions as expected with a user&#39;s data.
