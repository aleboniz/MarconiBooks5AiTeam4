| **Project Title:** Marconi Books |
| --- |
| **Start Date:** 24/10/2019 | **End Date:** 12/12/2019 |
| **Project Manager:** Drago Nicola |
| **Project Sponsor:** ITI Marconi |
| **Customer:** ITI Marconi |
| **Users:** ITI Marconi&#39;s students |
| **Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**: The purpose of our project is to create a platform where students of ITI Marconi can easily exchange and sale textbooks. Currently students must go physically to book shop or they must buy it online. Adding a web app will allow Marconi&#39;s students to buy and sell their books directly with other students. |
| **Goals and Objectives** : The general goal of the project is to design and create a website to allow an easier books exchange between students of ITI Marconi.  The website is expected to:
- .be usable. It should allow users to register and create a personal account.
- .be useful. It should inform students about the available books.
- .be convenient. It should allow customers to directly contact sellers.
- .be easy to use. It should require no prior computer experience using a simple engaging interface.
- .offer at least two modes: a sale mode and a purchase mode. In the sale mode the user can add a book that he would like to sell by fill a simple form. In the purchase mode users can search a book that they need by filter particular features require.

| **Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**: The initial project budget is $00.000 The project manager and lead programmer are being compensated for their efforts with a good mark. |
| **Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:**. There is very little flexibility with respect to quality : The software must be easy to use and reliable. |
| **Approach:** P  |
| **Constraints** : The final solution should not have any bugs or any kind of problem |
| **Assumptions** : We assume that the customer and a few of the users will be available to participate in 1-2 initial requirements gathering meetings. We also assume that the customer will be available during the requirements phase to answer questions. Turnaround time on questions should be no longer than 2 days. Feedback on all three iterations is needed from both the customer and user representatives.The Welcome Center will provide appropriate written material on campus buildings and structures. The project team will create audio narrations based on this written material.The device does nothing to ensure its own physical security. The person or organization loaning the device is responsible for the device&#39;s physical security.On the technical side, we assume the device isn&#39;t required to work from a car, indoors, or under an enclosed structure such as a sheltered walkway. |
| **Success Criteria** : Product success is defined by the full possibility of selling and buying books in a easy way.  |
| **Scope** : Adding and editing content on campus structures may require a programming change. The application isn&#39;t required to provide a simple user interface for updating content.As mentioned in the goals section above, the delivered product should demonstrate the ability to deliver content tailored to the user&#39;s preferences, but a complete implementation of this feature is beyond the scope of the current project. |
| **Risks and obstacles to success** : The programming staff has little experience in developing with SQL Databases and PHP.The solution almost certainly will require a multi-threaded implementation. Debugging a multi-threaded program is difficult and unpredictable. One or two hard-to-find defects could easily extend the testing phase beyond the scheduled project end date. |
