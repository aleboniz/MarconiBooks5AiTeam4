| <u>**Project Title:**</u> Marconi Books <br>
| <u>**Start Date:**</u> 24/10/2019 <br>
| <u>**End Date:**</u> 12/12/2019 <br>
| <u>**Project Manager:**</u> Drago Nicola <br>
| <u>**Project Sponsor:**</u> ITI Marconi <br>
| <u>**Customer:**</u> ITI Marconi <br>
| <u>**Users:**</u> ITI Marconi&#39;s students <br>

| <u>**Purpose (Problem or opportunity addressed by the project)**</u>: The purpose of our project is to create a platform where students of ITI Marconi can easily exchange and sale textbooks. Currently students must go physically to book shop or they must buy it online. Adding a web app will allow Marconi&#39;s students to buy and sell their books directly with other students. 

| <u>**Goals and Objectives**</u> : The general goal of the project is to design and create a website to allow an easier books exchange between students of ITI Marconi.  The website is expected to:
- *be usable*: it should allow users to register and create a personal account.
- *be useful*: it should inform students about the available books.
- *be convenient*: It should allow customers to directly contact sellers.
- *be easy to use*: It should require no prior computer experience using a simple engaging interface.
- *offer at least two modes*: a sale mode and a purchase mode. In the sale mode the user can add a book that he would like to sell by fill a simple form. In the purchase mode users can search a book that they need by filter particular features require.

| <u>**Schedule Information (Major milestones and deliverables)**</u>: The following milestones are planned. They should not be made public outside of the immediate project team. The project duration is about 2 months. The schedule below is based on a 2-month project life cycle.

| <u>**Financial Information (Cost estimate and budget information)**</u>: The project doesn't expect any cost. The development of the Maconi Books platform require computer equipment and a internet connection. 

| <u>**Project Priorities and degrees of freedom:**</u>. There is very little flexibility with respect to quality : The software must be easy to use and reliable. 

| <u>**Approach:**</u> Iterative and incremental approached are planned.  Feedback will be used from one iteration to the next.  The group will follow the Scrum rules, by planning the work week per week. The first iteration will focus on basic building and functionality of the app.  Subsequent iterations will build upon that and incorporate more features as time allows.

| <u>**Constraints**</u> : The most demanding constraint is the deadline, because insufficient time could limit the total realization of all the functionalities. The project could be expanded after the deadline.

| <u>**Assumptions**</u> : Marconi terminals are available, function and usable from Marconi Books website. It will possible interfacing the app with third-party website is feasible.

| <u>**Success Criteria**</u> : Product success is defined by the full possibility of selling and buying books in a easy way. 

| <u>**Scope**</u> : Adding and editing content on campus structures may require a programming change. The application isn&#39;t required to provide a simple user interface for updating content. As mentioned in the goals section above, the delivered product should demonstrate the ability to deliver content tailored to the user&#39;s preferences, but a complete implementation of this feature is beyond the scope of the current project. 

| <u>**HeadingRisks and obstacles to success**</u>:  The programming staff has little experience in developing with SQL Databases and PHP.The solution almost certainly will require a multi-threaded implementation. Debugging a multi-threaded program is difficult and unpredictable. One or two hard-to-find defects could easily extend the testing phase beyond the scheduled project end date.
